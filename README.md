## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a multiplayer online casino game that was released in 2019.
The game is based on a simple concept: a plane takes off and flies
across the screen. The higher the plane flies, the higher the
multiplier. Players must cash out before the plane flies away to win
their bet.

Aviator is a fast-paced and exciting game that can be very rewarding.
The game is also very social, as players can chat with each other while
they are playing.

## How to Play Aviator

To play Aviator, you will need to first create an account at an online
casino that offers the game. Once you have created an account, you can
deposit funds and start playing.

To start a game of Aviator, you will need to choose a bet amount. You
can bet as little as \$0.10 or as much as \$100. Once you have chosen
your bet amount, you will need to click the "Bet" button.

The plane will then take off and start flying across the screen. The
higher the plane flies, the higher the multiplier. You can cash out at
any time by clicking the "Cash Out" button.

If you cash out before the plane flies away, you will win your bet
multiplied by the multiplier. If the plane flies away before you cash
out, you will lose your bet.
